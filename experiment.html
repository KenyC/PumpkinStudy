				last about 10 mins.</p>
				<p>Your participation is voluntary and you can decide to quit the
				experiment at any time.</p>
				<p><strong>However, please note that in order to validate the task, you
				need to complete the experiment and wait until the results are sent
				(this should take only a few seconds).</strong></p>
				<p>Otherwise, we have no way to ensure that you participated at all.</p>
				<p>You will be paid for your participation in this study at the rate
				posted on Prolific.</p>
				<p>Your participation in this study will remain confidential. Your
				individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data
				resulting from the study.</p>
